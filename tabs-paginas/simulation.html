<h3>FreeSpace 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The year is 2367. Thirty-two years have passed since the Great War. The only jump node to Sol collapsed long ago, isolating Earth from the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA), a new government uniting old enemies. As the Terrans and Vasudans struggle to rebuild their civilizations, civil war erupts in the Polaris system. A rogue Terran admiral declares war against the Vasudans, and his rebellion threatens the stability of the Alliance.</p>
<p>Without warning, the Shivans return, and the GTVA launches a crusade to eliminate their Great War nemesis. Once again, the Alliance must crush the Shivan onslaught or else face annihilation."</p>

<h3>Heavy Gear II</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The terrible Interpolar War between the Confederated Northern City-States and the Allied Southern Territories has reached a cease-fire on Terra Nova. We, the provisionary leadership of the two polar confederations, have agreed that in the face of our new common threat, an effort must be made to prevent future extra-planetary invasions of Terra Nova. Our first step has been to form an elite special ops Gear unit, made up of the best pilots from all over the planet, irrespective of league allegiance. As one of these pilots, you are among the finest warriors in our history, and you will be outfitted with top-of-the-line Gear equipment to match your elite warrior status."</p>
