<h3>NHL 2002</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rush the net in pursuit of the game-winning goal, guard the crease with your life to shut out the opposition, and watch it all from the player's point of view. In this game, you are the hero. New features include the 'Breakaway Camera,' 'EA GameStory' which recognizes and rewards outstanding performance, and 'Create-a-Player' so you can really put yourself in the game. Whether you're an intense power forward or bruising defenseman, you'll feel pure adrenaline as you take the ice -- but don't take our word for it, experience it for yourself."</p>
